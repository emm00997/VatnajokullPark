  <p class="icewords"> <strong class="icetitle">The Vatnajokull Ice Cave</strong> <br> Also known as Anaconda Ice Cave and Crystal Ice Cave. The glacier gets its “crystal” name because of its crystal-blue ice. <br> The cave can be found on the south side of the Vatnajokull glacier and the ice looks blue due to the density of the it. The ice is much thicker and denser than regular ice for example, an ice cube in your freezer takes only a few hours to freeze where as glacier ice is a result of a process that takes hundreds of years of snowflakes falling and compressing and re-crystallizing into ice, creating the crystal clear blue ice.
   The best time to see the caves and get a tour is, <br> Early November - Late April. </p>
